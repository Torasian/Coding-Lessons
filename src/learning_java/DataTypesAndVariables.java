		//A variable stores the value of a data item. This value can change.
		// Below we create an integer variable called 'number'. We have not assigned it a value.
		// This is called, declaring a variable.
		int number;
		// Here we assign number a value
		number = 1;
		
		//We can also print out variables, it will just print out the value assigned to the variable.
		//Exercise 2: Print out the variable "number"
		
		//We can declare and assign a variable like this:
		String hello = "Hello";
		
		//so far we have introduced 2 data types, an integer and a String.
		//There are many more different data types: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html
		
		//Exercise 3: Create a variable of type String and assign it to your names. After this, print it out.
